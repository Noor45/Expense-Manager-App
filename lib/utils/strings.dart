The app provides a platform where business owners can register, create a portal, add their bank details, and manage various financial operations, including tracking expenses and adding credit to their bank accounts. Users can categorize their expenses under different headings such as general or business, and within these categories, they can further classify expenses into specific types like food, bills, taxes, and other relevant categories. When a user incurs an expense, the corresponding amount can be automatically deducted from the selected bank account as designated within the app. The accuracy of such transactions is dependent on the correct input of data by the user, and it is the user\'s responsibility to ensure that all financial information, including bank details and transaction amounts, is accurate and up-to-date. Expense Wallet serves as a tool for financial management and does not function as a financial institution. Therefore, users are advised to regularly review their bank statements and app records to ensure that all transactions are recorded accurately. Any discrepancies between the app's records and the user's actual bank statements should be immediately reported to both the financial institution and the app\'s support team. Users can also add credit to their linked bank accounts through the app, which may involve external payment processors. Expense Wallet does not handle the actual transfer of funds but facilitates the process by integrating with third-party services.

Users agree to indemnify and hold harmless Expense Wallet and its affiliates from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney\'s fees, arising out of or in any way connected with their access to or use of the app, violation of these Terms, or any illegal or unauthorized use of the app. Expense Wallet reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the app or any features or portions thereof without prior notice.
